# Release of SBLGNT Context Annotation

We are pleased to make available the `1.1.0` release of the OpenText Context Annotation. This release includes the following features:

*   **New Trees** following the SBLGNT edition of the Greek New Testament, which was recently made available on a CC license

## Work in Progress

We are currently in the process of comparing the OpenText `turn` elements to the data contained in Clear Bible's [speaker-quotations](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/speaker-quotations) dataset. We will be making a new release of the OpenText Context Annotation once this comparison is complete. We may augment the speaker-quotations dataset with identification for speakers in nested speaker turns.
