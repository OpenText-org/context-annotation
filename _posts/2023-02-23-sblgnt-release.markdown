# Release of SBLGNT Context Annotation

We are pleased to make available the `1.1.0` release of the OpenText Context Annotation. This release includes the following features:

*   **New Trees** following the SBLGNT edition of the Greek New Testament, which was recently made available on a CC license

## Schema Changes

Rather than giving each element a `<c>` tag, we have now simply called each element according to its type. E.g., 
```xml
<!-- Each book of the New Testament comprises a text node -->
<text id="3John">
  <!-- Each text comprises at least one turn -->
  <c unit="turn">
    <!-- Each turn is broken down into zero or more turn segments -->
    <c unit="seg" title="Address and Commendation">
      <!-- Each turn (or turn segment) comprises one or more moves -->
      <c unit="move" id="N1904.3John.1.1.1-10">
        <!-- Each move includes any expressions realizing that move -->
        <e id="N1904.3John.1.1.1" 
           clearId="n64001001001">á½‰</e>
        ...
```

`@usfm` identifiers have been removed.

`@clearId` now follows the alphabetically sortable order of the IDs used in the [macula-greek](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek) repository.
## Work in Progress

We are currently in the process of comparing the OpenText `turn` elements to the data contained in Clear Bible's [speaker-quotations](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/speaker-quotations) dataset. We will be making a new release of the OpenText Context Annotation once this comparison is complete. We may augment the speaker-quotations dataset with identification for speakers in nested speaker turns.
